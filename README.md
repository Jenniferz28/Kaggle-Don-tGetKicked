# Kaggle-Don'tGetKicked
Hi there. 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/DontGetKicked It is an old competetion. But i think it is still fun to play with it. 
This is just show how I do Kaggle, where to start and how to improve. It is not for full-competence. To get improve the model, a lot of work
is still needed, even the data size is small.
Let's play!
